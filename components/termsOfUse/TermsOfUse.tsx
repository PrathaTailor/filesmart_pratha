            <h3>Governing Law:</h3>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of North Carolina, except for those conflicts of law rules thereof that would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State for any dispute arising from or related to these Terms and your use of the Site.
            </p>

            <h3>Disputes:</h3>
            <p>
              ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision; the arbitrator shall apply North Carolina law to all other matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. BY ACCESSING THE SITE AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR LITIGATE ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</p>
            <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, send an email requesting arbitration and describing your claim to <a href="mailto:support@FileSmart.tax">support@FileSmart.tax</a>. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.adr.org</a> or by calling <a href="tel:18007787879">1-800-778-7879</a>. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA’s rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Section shall survive expiration, termination or rescission of the Services.</p>

            <h3>Severability:</h3>
            <p>
              If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If a court finds that any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, such provision will be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced so as to apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h3>Extent of Relationship:</h3>
            <p>The relationship of the parties established by these Terms is that of independent contractors, and nothing contained in these Terms shall be construed to create a joint venture or partnership between you and us or to give either you or us the power to act as agent for the other party or to enter into any agreement on behalf of the other party.</p>

            <p>If you sign up for a third party service that requires access to your information on an ongoing basis and you subsequently want us to stop making your information available to such third party, you should discontinue use of the third party services.

            <p><b><u>Fee Arrangement.</u></b> Fees for the work are covered with your membership for as long as your membership is in good standing and not canceled or in default. Pending information gleaned from your transcripts or additional information not yet known, additional fees for work outside our terms of service, may be required. Should your case fall into this category, you will be presented with a proposal for additional fees at that time.</p>

            <p>In unusual circumstances, cases become significantly more complicated or time consuming than initially anticipated. We reserve the right to revise the flat fee to reflect the expertise required and any additional time expended. Please note that only a small percentage of our cases ever require an adjustment to our initial quote. We will keep you fully informed if we later determine that your case may be of an unusual type requiring more time or expertise than initially anticipated.</p>

            <p><b><u>Communication Between Us.</u></b> We will communicate with you by email, phone, fax, and any other reasonable method. An express condition of the Engagement is that you remain in contact with us and timely provide any documentation we or any taxing agency may request. If we or any taxing agency attempt to contact you during the Engagement or to request documentation from you but do not receive a response from you within ten (10) days, we reserve the right to interpret such silence or inaction to mean that you have terminated the Engagement.</p>

            <p><b><u>Communication between You, Us, and IRS.</u></b> You will not be required to talk to, meet, or deal with revenue officers during the course of our Engagement. While some clients may feel a need to contact the revenue officer directly, we strongly encourage you to refrain from contacting the revenue agent and instead work through our tax professionals.</p>

            <p><b><u>Other Client Duties.</u></b> You agree to file returns as required by any agreements, settlements, or compromises that are made with the IRS or other taxing agency. You further agree to stay current on all future tax liabilities as they become due. Failure to stay current with any and all tax liabilities will be cause for us to terminate this agreement as it would affect our ability to represent you.</p>

            <p>You agree to: (i) respond promptly to any reasonable requests for instructions, information, or approvals required to provide the services; (ii) cooperate with us in our performance of the service; and (iii) take all steps necessary, including obtaining required consents, to prevent delays in our provision of the services. </p>

            <p><b><u>Access.</u></b> In connection with the performance of our services, you shall provide us with all such cooperation and assistance as we may reasonably request, or as otherwise may reasonably be required, to enable us to perform our services and to exercise our rights under and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this letter, including all necessary authorizations and consents, whether from third parties or otherwise.</p>

            <p><b><u>True and Accurate Information.</u></b> For our relationship to succeed, it is essential for you to provide us with all factual information reasonably relevant and material to the subject matter of the Engagement. Please be aware failure to disclose the nature, source, and extent of any assets, liabilities, income, or expense may ultimately invalidate any agreement between you and a taxing agency.</p>

            <p><b><u>Termination.</u></b> We look forward to a fruitful relationship with you. Nevertheless, you are free to terminate our representation of you at any time. We will have the same right. Upon completion of the Engagement, or the earlier termination of the Engagement, our relationship will end unless we expressly agree in writing to continue to represent you on other matters.</p>

            <h2 className={`${styles.exhibitSub} ${styles.center}`}>IRS Shield Terms & Membership</h2>

            <h3>Clarification of Terms:</h3>
            <p>We are a private company and NOT the IRS. “<b>IRS</b>” refers to the Internal Revenue Service and “<b>State</b>” refers to any state income tax authority.</p>
            <p>“<b>Covered Membership Period</b>” means the timeframe that begins with the first month of Membership and ends with the last month of paid Membership as defined herein.</p>
            <p>Generally, each Membership is associated with a taxpayer or taxpayer(s) in conjunction with a filed tax extension. The Covered Membership Period will pertain to any/all notices received by the covered taxpayer(s) within the period of active Membership (such Membership, a “<b>Covered Membership</b>,” and such taxpayer, a “<b>Covered Member</b>”).</p>
            <p>IRS Correspondence or IRS Notices means any letter from the IRS pertaining to the Member taxpayer or taxpayer(s) within the period of active Membership. Covered Members are natural persons listed as a taxpayer, or in the case of a married filing joint return, both the taxpayer and the spouse, or in the case of a business, it would be that business associated with the purchase of a business extension. Memberships are not transferable.</p>
            <p>Membership is a benefit extended by IRS Shield to the Members as defined and limited by these Terms. Membership date means the date that IRS Shield receives your Membership application and payment in full, and your application is approved. In the event that you are offered a free trial, Membership begins upon your acceptance of our terms related to the free trial. Your acceptance date appears on the status page that is accessible post login and created by you prior to purchase. Period of Membership is the period of time for which services are available for a Covered Membership. Unless otherwise provided in writing, this period begins on the Membership enrollment date and ends upon cancellation, or thirty (30) days after a given month’s calendar billing period.</p>
            <p>For example, the period of Membership for an IRS Shield subscription purchased on April 18, 2022 will be from April 18, 2022 to May 17, 2022. On May 18, 2022, pending the successful processing of the monthly fee, the service will continue through July 17, 2022. Should you request cancellation, you will no longer be charged, and the cancellation will take effect at the end of the next billing period. Continuing with the example above, if you were to cancel on July 1, 2022, you would still have access to the service until July 17, 2022. If you did not cancel, but your credit card was unable to process the July 18, 2022 charge, you will be eligible for a grace period that lasts through the current billing period. If you are unable to successfully process your payment during that grace period, your service will expire.</p>


            <h3>Who Can Use This IRS Shield Service?</h3>

              The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the IRS Shield Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.

            <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
            <p>In general, our responsibility will be to operate a website to deliver the services to you. Your responsibility will be to ensure your registration is complete at our website. To access our website, you will need a username and password. You must keep this username and password secure and not share it with other people. If you share your username and password or use the same username and password for other services, other people having access to your username and password may gain access to your personal information everywhere this combination is used. You must also keep your contact information including your phone number, email address, and physical address current so we can contact you about your Membership and the IRS Shield Services as needed.</p>
            <p>Each individual IRS Shield Service has its own additional responsibilities and these responsibilities are described below.</p>

            <p><b>IRS Correspondence Service:</b></p>
            <p>Our responsibility will be to provide you with a written response for you to provide to the IRS in response to a notice they send to you. All transactions and communication will be in English.</p>
            <p>Your responsibility will be to provide us the information we need to develop a written response to the letter from the IRS.</p>
            <p>This means that you must do the following:</p>

            <ul className={styles.listOne}>
              <li>Contact us as soon as you receive a letter or notice from the IRS. Do not contact the IRS first.</li>
              <li>To contact us, go to our website, login, and follow the instructions to report a letter from the IRS.</li>
              <li>If you contact us more than fourteen (14) days after your first notice, it is possible that a response may not be available before the required response date on the letter, or, additional fees may apply.</li>
              <li>Provide a signed IRS Form 2848 Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, which is required for us to be able to discuss your return with the IRS if necessary.</li>
              <li>Provide a return transcript, or authorize us to pull it on your behalf. You can obtain a free electronic transcript at IRS.gov that you can provide to us for the year and tax return pertaining to your letter or notice.</li>
              <li>Provide additional information. IRS Correspondence often requires information beyond what was provided on the tax return. In some cases, the notice may request documents to prove or substantiate a position, claim, or other statement on the tax return. In order to benefit from this service, you must provide copies of this additional information in the time specified if and when we request it. You are responsible for any expenses related to obtaining these documents.</li>
              <li>Follow our suggestions. We ask that you comply with the procedure and strategy that we prescribe and that you submit the exact response we generate for you to the IRS. If you are unable or choose or do not to follow the procedure and strategy, modify the response we generate for you, or do not send the response we generate for you, we will not be able to respond to subsequent letters from the IRS and cannot be responsible for the outcome of your situation and reserve the right to cease providing the IRS Shield Services.</li>
              <li>Provide accurate and pertinent information. You must provide all of the information required timely, accurately, and truthfully.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Federal Tax Return Amendments:</b></p>
            <p>Our responsibility will be to suggest adjustments for you to make on your return, per the notices received. Depending upon the assistance and work required, this may result in additional fees.</p>
            <p>If you agree, this means you will:</p>
            <p>Make changes to your return. Use a do-it-yourself tax software of your choice to make any changes to your return or hire a tax preparer. We are not your tax return preparer and cannot provide you tax advice during the amendment process unless you choose to engage us for a separate fee.</p>
            <p>Print the amendment. Once you complete making changes to your return, you can add additional details required by the IRS Form 1040-X and download or print the IRS Form 1040-X.</p>
            <p>In order to complete the amendment process you will need to print out the IRS Form 1040-X and any additional supporting amended forms and documents required to show the changes made to your return.</p>
            <p>Sign the Amendment. The IRS requires that amendments, like tax returns, are signed by the taxpayer and, if filing a joint return, both the taxpayer and the spouse.</p>
            <p>Mail the amendment to the IRS. The IRS does not accept amended returns electronically, so it must be mailed to the IRS at the address provided.</p>
            <p>Should you need our specific help to revise your tax return, this will be outside of the scope of the Membership and if you choose, we will present you with a proposal to complete the work.</p>
            <p><b>Document Storage:</b></p>
            <p>Our responsibility will be to allow you to upload PDF formatted files to a secure portal for storage and retrieval during the Covered Membership Period.
